# 🎄❄️☃️🎅 Advent of Code - 2018 🎄❄️☃️🎅
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a series of small programming puzzles.

This year, I've decided to solve them in [Go](https://golang.org/).

You can also see my [2017 repository](https://github.com/SwiftPush/advent-of-code-2017).

## Building
```
go build -o main
```

## Running
All the solutions take the input filename as a command line flag, e.g.
```
./main input.txt
```
